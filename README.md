## This web application is about an Akan naming system found in Ghana.It gives the akan names of both male and female depending on the day of the week you were born. It contains a user form where a user can input their month, year and date of birth and select the gender to provide the Akan name.

https://github.com/paulinenanzala19/Akan_Names.git

## BDD
The website will require a user to fill out information about their date of birth, month and the year they were born. The application uses a calender to select. One will be required to choose their gender and then click on the submit button in order to generate his/her Akan name. The application matches the day of the week with a specific Akan Name and outputs it to the user with a personalized message.
